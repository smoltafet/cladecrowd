# Clade: Enriching The Ummah
Clade is a crowdfunding web application designed specifically for mosques.
New or existing mosques can organize a listing and people from the community, 
or around the world can help contribute. 

The project is a work in progress!
What we currently finished:
We currently have a functioning authentication system, as well as a backend
that pulls listing from other crowdfunding sites such as GoFundMe. We are also
fully hosted through Cloudflare.

Tools: React, Firebase, Cloudlare, and Node.js

Project is hosted at: cladecrowd.pages.dev

To run locally project: 
1. Clone the project.
2. npm install
3. cd my-app
4. npm start
